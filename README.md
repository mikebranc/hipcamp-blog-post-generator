## About the creator of this repo
Hi there! If you're reading this and work at Hipcamp, my name is Michael Branconier and I am very passionate about the outdoors. I grew up attending summer camps, going camping with my family and even started a camping club at my high school. It sort of runs in my genes. My mom works as an executive director for the american camp association and my father has spent decades working with summer camps and outdoor education programs. Needless to say, your mission of getting more people outside is one I agree with deeply.

While this passion for the outdoors is high, my passion for technology may match it. I have worked as a software engineer for almost 2 years where I have had the opportunity to build some cool software for companies like MyCase. I recently have been diving head first into generative AI and through my perserverance, have been fortunate enought to build out AI powered software at my company. Additionally, I have built some cool projects outside of work like a [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/comp-crunch-analyze-zillo/pfmjlnebociiohfhlpckomcmnajdonjp) that helps people make better informed zillow searches and a [rent roll extractor](https://credataextractor.com/) that helps multifamily analysts save time underwriting. 

I'm hoping that I can bring this passion I have for tech along with my passion for the outdoors to Hipcamp so we can build awesome things. When I saw the posting for an engineer on the growth team, I thought I would put my skills to the test by quickly building something that seems like it would be useful to the team. I hope you guys think the same and am looking forward to hopefully working with you soon.
